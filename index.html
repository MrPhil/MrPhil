Iâ€™m a game developer and programmer. I make mobile games for Zynga using C# and Unity3D. In my personal time I explore game design, game jamming, programming, computer languages, and game development tools. This website is the home to all my experiments, gamejams, games, prototypes, gamedev tools and blog posts.</p>
